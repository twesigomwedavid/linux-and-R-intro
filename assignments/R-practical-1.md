## R/Rstudio Practical 

Set the working directory in Rstudio to ~/r-tutorial/practical1 (create one if necessary)
Write all the code for this practical in an Rscript ``practical1.R``

### Task 1

1. Create the following vectors: 
- `tools` composed of tool1, tool2, and tool3
- `DEL` composed of 38, 25, and 10
- `DUP` composed of 50, 40 and 12
- `INV` composed of 42, 33, and 20

1(b) What is the mode of vector `tools` and vector `DEL`?  

1(c) Create a dataframe `cnvs` from the above 4 vectors. Be sure to use the tools vector as the row names. 

1(d) How would you verify the number of rows and columns in the data fram `cnvs`

1(e) How would you select all elements of the column `DEL`? 

1(f) Results have just come in for insertions (INS) called by each tool. Create a vector 'INS' composed of 20, 28, and 14. Add a column for `INS` to the cnvs data frame and save the updated data frame as cnvs2.
