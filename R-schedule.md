## MSc (Med) Genomic Medicine — R Tutorial Schedule 

R is a free and open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics, hence it is one of the most widely used programming languages/environments in Bioinformatics. R programming is supported by a wide variety of Linux/Unix platforms, Windows and MacOS. 

A plethora of R packages have been developed and shared for multiple data science operations. Some packages (e.g. ``tidyverse``) are distributed as a collection of multiple sub-packages. For purposes of this tutorial, we will focus on packages within ``Base-R``. 


### Learning outcomes
- Getting familiar with the Rstudio environment

- Introduction to R code syntax

- Introduction to R data structures

- Learning how to write simple R scripts

- Learning how to make simple plots in R 

- Learning how to run simple/common statistical genetics tests in R



## Setup and installation of R and Rstudio
Kindly follow instructions at https://www.r-project.org/ and https://posit.co/ and from the in-class tutorial.

## Session 1 — Learning R with ``swirl``

Swirl is an R package with interactive R courses.
