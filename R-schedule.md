## MSc (Med) Genomic Medicine — R Tutorial Schedule 

R is a free and open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics, hence it is one of the most widely used programming languages/environments in Bioinformatics. R programming is supported by a wide variety of Linux/Unix platforms, Windows and MacOS. 

A plethora of R packages have been developed and shared for multiple data science operations. Some packages (e.g. ``tidyverse``) are distributed as a collection of multiple sub-packages. For purposes of this tutorial, we will mainly focus on packages within ``Base-R``. 


### Advantages of using R for statistical data analysis and visualisation in Genetics? 

- There are a lot of R online resources and tutorials to lean on
- Analyses in R can be easily replicated on new datasets
- R provides many options for creating publication-quality figures and visualisations
- R code can be uploaded to online repositories for other people to reproduce your analysis
- R offers cross-platform compatibility
- R is free to use

## Setup and installation of R and Rstudio
Kindly follow instructions at https://www.r-project.org/ and https://posit.co/ and from the in-class tutorial.

## Session 1 — Learning R with ``swirl``

Swirl is an R package with interactive R courses. 

### Installing swirl in Rstudio

```
install.packages('swirl')
```

### Launching swirl in Rstudio

```
library(swirl)
```

For this MSc (Med) Genomic Medicine programme, we will focus on the R programming course in ``swirl``. Please follow the prompts and complete the following lessons within this course:

- Basic Building Blocks 

- Workspace and Files   

- Sequences of Numbers 

- Vectors 

- Missing Values

- Matrices and Data Frames

- Functions 



## Session 2

### Plotting in R
For this tutorial, we will primarily follow plotting code and tips from https://r-graph-gallery.com (example data may be customisable)

Download the plots [https://github.com/twesigomwedavid/linux-and-R-intro/blob/main/scripts/plots.R] Rscript, open it in Rstudio, and follow the prompts.

### Statistical tests in R
For this tutorial, we will practice how to run basic statistical tests in R. Download the stats Rscript, open it in Rstudio, and follow the prompts.
